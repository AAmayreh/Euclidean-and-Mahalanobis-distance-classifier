# Euclidean-and-Mahalanobis-distance-classifier

a 2-class classification task in a 3-dimensional space, where the two classes, ω1 and ω2 are modelled by Gaussian distributions with means m1 = [0, 0, 0]T and m2 = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]T , respectively. Assuming the two classes to be equiprobable. The covariance matrix for both distributions is:
S = [0.01 0.2 0.01, 
     0.01 0.2 0.01,
     0.01 0.01 0.2]
     
     Given the point x = [0.1, 0.5, 0.1]T
